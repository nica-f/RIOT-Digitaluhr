@brief       Support for the STM32 Nucleo-l496zg

## Overview

The Nucleo-L496ZG is a board from ST's Nucleo family supporting ARM Cortex-M4
STM32L496ZG ultra-low-pawer microcontroller with 320KiB of RAM and 1 MiB of Flash.

## Flashing the Board Using ST-LINK Removable Media

On-board ST-LINK programmer provides via composite USB device removable media.
Copying the HEX file causes reprogramming of the board. This task
could be performed manually; however, the cpy2remed (copy to removable
media) PROGRAMMER script does this automatically. To program board in
this manner, use the command:
```
make BOARD=nucleo-l496zg PROGRAMMER=cpy2remed flash
```
@note This PROGRAMMER was tested using ST-LINK firmware 2.37.26. Firmware updates
      can be found on [this STM webpage](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link007.html
